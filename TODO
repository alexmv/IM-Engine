More interfaces:
    REPL
    DJabberd
    IRC
    Test?

Figure out a policy for capabilities such as:
    HTML
    Buddy list
    User profile
    Avatar

Make sure that we encode messages properly for all interfaces

Warning and error callbacks

Run requests inside of an eval because killing the bot is bad

Best practices for using IM::Engine to *just* send a set of messages, perhaps
staggered over time (use case: an appointment reminder bot)

Don't require the runloop, especially if it's not required (such as for both
AIM and Jabber)

Plugins for things like aliases?

Jifty::Plugin::IM
